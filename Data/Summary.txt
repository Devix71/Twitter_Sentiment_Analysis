The Twitter post data was colected using [Twint]((https://github.com/twintproject/twint)),
an open source Twitter scraper,
by selecting the posts containing the stock tickers $AMD, $NVDA, $TSLA and $NASDAQ.
After collecting the posts, they have been moved from a json format into an xlsx format for faster parsing.
In the Dataset file there are all sets of data, in their own respective sheets,
which are used in the various analyses used in this project.
The sheets are categorized by their analysis type, where R means simple linear regression,
MR means multiple regression and LR means logistical regression
